                            Google Summer of Code is a worldwide online program aimed at attracting new contributors to open-source software development. Participants are matched with mentors from open-source organizations, gain insights into real-world development practices, learn from seasoned developers, and receive a small stipend.

                            LAPPIS was one of the 195 mentoring organizations for GSoC 2024—and one of only 30 organizations participating for the first time. We mentored four newcomers, which brought fresh perspectives to our local community while deepening our understanding of the platform.

                            Participating in GSoC allowed us to connect with students globally. This was more than just a technical exchange; it was also a social and cultural opportunity that broadened the professional horizons of both mentors and participants. We learned a great deal from this experience and look forward to participating again.
