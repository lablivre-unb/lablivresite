description: >
  As GovHub grows, monitoring data pipelines, lineage, failures and costs becomes increasingly complex. A unified
  observability and governance layer is needed to give a global view of the platform and ensure reliability of the
  published data.

  This project focuses on building dashboards, metrics and alerts that allow maintainers and stakeholders to track
  data freshness, pipeline health, SLA adherence and data usage in a transparent way. The student will be responsible
  for designing meaningful indicators, wiring them into the existing stack and documenting how they should be operated
  in production.
